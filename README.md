# Cytopathology Challenge Editor

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your MEAN Material application.

The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application, to learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.

To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again, in the application folder run this in the command-line:

```
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
                            
That's it! your application should be running by now, to proceed with your development check the other sections in this documentation.

## Simple usage

0. Open a shell in a recent linux (we use Ubuntu 14.04+). You must be root (`sudo su -`) unless you already have `docker` running and a compatible version of `docker-compose` installed
1. Download the launch script: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rotarudan/cytopathologyeditor/master/cytoeditor.sh`
2. Mark the script as executable, and launch it: `chmod +x cytoeditor.sh && ./cytoeditor.sh launch` (note that it requires `bash` to run). Besides `launch`, the scripts accepts several other commands - use `./cytoeditor.sh --help` to see their names and descriptions.

* To enable live reload forward 35729 port and mount /app and /public as volumes:
```bash
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 35729:35729 -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/public:/home/mean/public -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/app:/home/mean/app --link db:db_1 mean
```

## Running in a secure environment
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following commnad: 
```
$ sh generate-ssl-certs.sh
```
Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority)
To generate the key and certificate and place them in the *config/sslcert* folder.

##Couple of things to be aware of
You can quickly change the basic theme of the application in the application.js file under public/ in the following block of code:

```
//Set up the color theme for the application https://material.angularjs.org/latest/#/Theming/01_introduction
angular.module(ApplicationConfiguration.applicationModuleName)
.config(function($mdThemingProvider) {
  $mdThemingProvider.theme('default')
    .primaryPalette('green')
    .accentPalette('light-green');
});
```

Secondly there are some hard coded CSS entries in material.css which are just in there for now to set some extra configs like the font sizes, etc. and some a element styling. You can easily find any of this in the web browser inspector I'm sure.

## Getting Started With MEAN.JS
You have your application running but there are a lot of stuff to understand, we recommend you'll go over the [Official Documentation](http://meanjs.org/docs.html). 
In the docs we'll try to explain both general concepts of MEAN components and give you some guidelines to help you improve your development process. We tried covering as many aspects as possible, and will keep update it by your request, you can also help us develop the documentation better by checking out the *gh-pages* branch of this repository.
